# Terminal Text Editor
This was a fun project and is also an extremely useful one. It is similar to emacs in some ways but extremely slimmed down.
The shortcuts are simple and more like classic shortcuts most people are used to like those in word and notepad. However,
despite being simple this editor is very powerful. It has its own internal terminal you can open with control-p. It also
allows you to browse and open any files in the current working directory by pressing control-f. It only takes one
command line argument to start up, the file name.
